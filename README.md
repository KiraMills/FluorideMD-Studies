# FluorideMD-Studies
Analysis and MD scripts to accompany the work: 


Files are organized by which case study (Fluc or CLCF) they were used for. Within each case study directory, there are subdirectories for MD simulation input/run scripts or analysis scripts. 

All of the simulation files are based off using the Amber20 pmemd.cuda software, if a different MD software will be used, you should contact their documentation. For more information about Amber, you can visit their website: ambermd.org

Additionally, analysis files are based off using the AmberTools cpptraj program to collect data from the simulation, and python3 to perform additional data analysis.
