## Start by loading in the prmtop and trajectory files.
## Note, you only want the first 50 ns of production simulation.
## In the example below, we are assuming each trajectory file
## has 20 ns of data, with 10 frames per ns, so we need all of 
## the first two files, but only 100 frames from the third. 

parm NAME.prmtop
trajin 07_Prod1.in 
trajin 07_Prod2.in
trajin 07_Prod3.in 1 100 1

## Now do the actual charge density calculation, 
density out charge_density.dat charge delta 0.25 “*”
run
